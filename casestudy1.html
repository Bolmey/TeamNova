                <p class='bigboy'>Providing feedback, like mark ups and commenting, is a key use case for collaboration,
                    but this
                    functionality was limited in Box. How could we increase engagement and promote the feedback loop in
                    Box?
                    I lead the redesign to extend our feature set to allow users to create annotations.</p>

                <p>The lifecycle of a document begins with creation, then sharing with others to get feedback, then
                    editing—
                    iterating until the final draft and approval. Users could not complete this feedback loop in Box,
                    and
                    thus were leaving Box to complete their workflows. We were losing users</p>

                <h2>Threaded Conversations</h2>
                <p>A simple change that resulted in in streamlined work processes. Previously, users could not reply to
                    any
                    comment— they had to sort through the sidebar to track down the conversation. Threading comments
                    together grouped conversations together for easy reading. I also updated the UX of the sidebar to
                    show
                    newest activity at the bottom, rather than the top</p>

                <h2>Viewing a Previous Version</h2>
                <p>One enormous challenge for me was overcoming technical constraints. One in particular resulted in all
                    annotations on the file itself being lost with any new version upload. To combat this, I ensured
                    there was a permanent record of every annotation in the sidebar, as well as a way to see all
                    annotations on a previous version. Clicking on any annotation would jump the user to the exact
                    version and location so they could compare changes and track the feedback</p>
